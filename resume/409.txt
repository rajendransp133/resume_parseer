content	experience	 Consumer Preferences (Traditional Market/Supermarket)
content	experience	Area Of Interest
content	experience	Linear Regression,Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,K-Means Clustering
content	experience	 Work on Decision Tree
content	experience	Data-Bank Marketing Dataset
content	experience	About-The dataset has been downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.The data is related with
content	experience	direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.
content	experience	I have done with the dataset.The goal is to build models which predict if the client will subscribe a term
content	experience	deposit(Y)
content	experience	Analysis-Perform some analysis on the dataset by choosing one or two variables and visualizing them,this
content	experience	way we can get an idea of how values are distributed for the entire set.
content	experience	Take ggplot functions to visualize the data distributions across the variables.
content	experience	Modeling-A decision Tree is a robust and transparent Machine Learning Model.It can be used to predict
content	experience	whether a particular variable would have mattered in the customer’s decision to subscribe or not to the
content	experience	Bank’s term deposit.
content	experience	Finally the summary of the Decision Tree plotted with the Chi-Squared value and the P-value.
content	experience	 Work on Logistic Regression
content	experience	Data-The Quality Dataset
content	experience	About-In this dataset we have 131 observations,One for each of the patients in our dataset,and 14
content	experience	different variables.The 12 variables from InpatientDays to AcuteDrugGapSmall are the independent
content	experience	variables.I am using the number of office visits and the number of prescriptions for narcotics that the
content	experience	patient had.
content	experience	Analysis-Use Table function to find out the outcome of the variable PoorCare.Next,We will randomly
content	experience	split our data into two dataset, Train and Test dataset.Now,Finding the correlation between all numeric
content	experience	variables.
content	experience	Modeling-Correlation between PoorCare and AcuteDrugGapSmall is significant,But Correlation between
content	experience	AcuteDrugGapSmall and Narcotics is higher and it can Cause the Multicollinearity so we will prefer to
content	experience	drop this variable from the Predictions because Narcotics seems more significant variable.So,We will build
content	experience	Logistic Regression Model using PoorCare as dependent Variable and OfficeVisits and Narcotics as
content	experience	independent variables.Made a Logistic Regression Model that can accurately identity Diabetic Patients
content	experience	Who receiving low quality care.The model provide probabilities of somebody Receiving Poor Quality
content	experience	Care.
content	experience	 Work on Linear Regression
content	experience	Data-AirQuality Dataset
content	experience	About-I have downloaded the data from stat.ethz.ch site.There are 153 observations and 6 variables.We
content	experience	have to create Linear Regression Model.But before that we have to identify the missing values.
content	experience	Analysis-In our dataset only Ozone and Solar.R attributes have some missing value.We need to impute
content	experience	those missing values(NA).After removing missing values now we perform Linear Regression on our
content	experience	dataset.
content	experience	Modeling-Apply Linear Regression Algorithm using Least Square Method on Ozone and Wind.Now
content	experience	Build scatterplot. The slope of the scatterplot of the line goes downwards,hence there exist a negative
content	experience	correlation between Ozone and Wind.
header	experience	 Internship-
content	experience	 ‘Research Intern’ for the NITI Aayog study on “Status on Women in Science
content	experience	among Select Institutions in India: Policy Implications’’ conducted by the Society for
content	experience	Socio-Economic Studies and Services (SSESS) during the period 1.08.2017-31.08.2017.
content	experience	 Experience-
content	experience	 Working with a NGO (THE GREEN CORNER), as a teacher (for underprivileged children)
content	experience	for last 1.5 years. I have also been appointed as the Treasurer in the NGO.
